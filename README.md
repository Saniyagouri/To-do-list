### Initializing the Project:

1. **Initialize the Project**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
2. **Create a New React App**: Run the following command to create a new React app using Create React App:
    
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app DirectoryName
    
    ```
    
    Replace `enhanced-todo-list` with your preferred project name.
    
3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the newly created project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd enhanced-todo-list
    
    ```
    

### Building and Running the Project:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies for the project:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    
    ```
    
2. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server to run the application locally:
    
    ```bash
    npm start
    
    ```
    
    This command will compile the code and open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
    
3. **Explore the Application**: You should now see the Todo List application running in your browser. You can interact with it, add new tasks, mark them as completed or incomplete, delete tasks, and filter them based on their completion status.

### Building for Production:

1. **Build the Application**: When you're ready to deploy the application or create a production build, you can run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    npm run build
    
    ```
    
    This command will create an optimized production build of your application in the `build` directory.
